								<h2>A symposium on renewable energy and the role of meteorology therein</h2>
								<p>Climate change, air quality issues, political instability and the exhaustive nature of fossil fuels all contribute to the notion that alternative energy sources should be exploited. Accordingly, governments have made appointments that are directed towards implementation of renewable energy systems. Over the past years, we have seen rooftops being covered with solar panels, and meadows populated with wind turbines. However, there is more to such a large transition than meets the eye. During this symposium, we hope to shed some light on the science and policy of renewable energy. We especially focus on the meteorology, that plays a key role in resource estimation, power prediction and load assessments.</p>
								<p>Below you will find information about each of the talks that will be presented during the symposium.</p>

								<h2>The energyscape</h2>
								<p>The first speaker will give an introduction of the (renewable) energy landscape. How much energy do we actually use, and what is the projected energy consumption in the coming century worldwide? Why do we need a transition to renewable energy sources and what are the actual appointments that have been made in the various conventions (horizon 2020, Paris 2015, ..)? How do the governments go about reaching these targets (subsidies etc.) and what are the challenges relating to the implementation of renewable energy systems (such as funding)?</p>

								<h2>Energy meteorology</h2>
								<p>This talk will cover the basics of meteorology that are necessary for wind and solar energy production. How does the angle of the sun and the cloud cover influence the productivity of solar panels, and why are offshore winds more suitable for wind energy than onshore? How to make sure that large wind turbines are not damaged during a storm? And what is the role of weather forecasts in energy trading? It will become clear that advanced meteorological knowledge can help improve energy yield and reduce the costs of renewable energy projects.</p>

								<h2>Climate impacts</h2>
								<p>Although intended as a measure to prevent further global warming, large-scale implementation of renewable energy sources may have a non-negligible climate impact as well. A lot of energy is withdrawn from the atmospheric system, which may impact its dynamics. This has not been studied extensively in the past, but it recently received more attention. This talk will address questions such as: how can renewables cause an impact on the climate? How large is this impact? How can we tell? And is it actually worth investing?</p>

								<h2>Sustainable cities</h2>
								<p>Renewables are finding their way into our daily lives. From panels on the rooftops to artificial solar trees to works that resemble art. What will our future cities look like? Will we all use electric cars as big batteries? Why do we need that smart gauge? And why is it not straightforward to implement many small energy plants to the grid?</p>
