Without such an engaged audience, the day would not have been as great. In addition to scheduled elements, they participated actively with questions and feedback throughout the day.

Before lunch, an interactive element was added to the programme to stimulate discussion. Using [an online questionnaire tool](https://getkahoot.com/) a number of propositions was presented and the participants could vote for one of the answers via their laptops or smartphones. This resulted in interesting discussions. Additionally, the audience was encouraged to contribute to a tangible outcome of the symposium by pasting post-its to what was introduced as an 'idea-tree'. On these post-its they could write questions, propositions, interesting facts, etc. The original idea was that these post-its would be used to guide a discussion at the end of the day, but it turned out this wasn't even necessary. Instead, the organizers requested that each participant write down a personal take-home message that they would like to share. These post-its are published below.
